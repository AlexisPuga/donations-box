# donations-box

## Usage
First, create your configuration file.

Then, right before you publish your site:
1. Add `<!-- donations-box -->` to any file (`my-file`, for example).
2. Run `donations-box my-file`. (Make sure to replace `my-file` with your file).
3. Check if `my-file` was updated and publish your website as you normally do!
